# Lily's [BetterDiscord](https;//github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord) Addons
Some themes ([Glass](https://github.com/Lylythii/Glass) & [Priscord](https://github.com/Lylythii/Priscord)) were moved from their original GitHub repositories to here.
Those have been archived & are now being kept up-to-date *here* instead.
The old repositories for them are kept for historical reasons.

# Licencing
Everything in this repository is individually licenced. For one reason or another. For the most part things are either MIT or ARR.
Though... simple CSS is just that, CSS... I can't exactly claim ownership of that.
I'm generally not bothered by how you use these, just don't claim ownership of them.
